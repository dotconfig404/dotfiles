! check xmodmap for layout

! this clears everything in the (caps) lock group. 
! currently it contains caps lock simply, but as keysym
! (names of keys are keysyms, they contain a code as well)
! thus when pressing the key with the code it would still be in the lock group, 
! despite not being symmed to Caps_Lock
!clear lock
! now we'll bind the keycode of capslock to the escape keysym replacing the old one
!keycode 66 = Escape
! and escape to capslock
!keycode 9 = Caps_Lock
! then we'll add Caps Lock to the modifier group Lock
!add lock = Caps_Lock

! ALT_L <-> CTRL_L
! similarly, switching left alt and left control
!remove control = Control_L
!remove mod1 = Alt_L
!keycode 37 = Alt_L
!keycode 64 = Control_L
!add control = Control_L
!add mod1 = Alt_L
!

!! SHIFT_L -> ALT_GR
!! ALT_GR -> HYPER
!!remove mod1 = Alt_R
!remove shift = Shift_R
!! we also need to remove hyper from mod4, as for some 
!! reason it is there together with the super key
!remove mod4 = Hyper_L
!keycode 62 = Alt_R
!keycode 108 = Hyper_L
!add mod1 = Alt_R
!add mod3 = Hyper_L
!
!! CAPS_LOCK -> SUPER_L
!clear lock
!remove mod4 = Super_L
!keycode 66 = Super_L
!add mod4 = Super_L
!
!
!! CONTROL_L -> SPACE
!remove control = Control_L
!keycode 65 = Control_L
!add control = Control_L
!keycode any = space



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! caps lock:    super_l
! alt_r:        escape
! shit_r:       alt_r
!!!!! super_l:      hyper_l


! lets clear the modifier groups so we can be sure about what is in there
clear mod1
clear mod3
clear mod4
! iso level 3 shift = alt_r, mode switch is yet another shift-like key
clear mod5
clear control
clear lock
clear shift


! now we map our custom keysyms
! space to control
!keycode 65 = Control_L
! caps_lock will have functionality of super_l
keycode 66 = Super_L
! alt_r will have functionality of escape
keycode 108 = Escape
! shift_r will have functionalty of alt_r
keycode 62 = ISO_Level3_Shift


! this is independent from the keycodes, no need to change here
! and finally we assign modifier groups again
! adding shit_l to the shift group
add shift = Shift_L
! adding control_l to the control group
add control = Control_L
! adding alt_l to the mod1 group
add mod1 = Alt_L
! adding hyper_l to the mod3 group
add mod3 = Hyper_L
!adding super_l to the mod4 group
add mod4 = Super_L
! adding alt_r to the mod5 group
add mod5 = ISO_Level3_Shift
remove Alt_R = Alt
