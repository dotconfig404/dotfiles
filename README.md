# How to run
run huifu.sh, that should take care of it
currently supported: Arch and Ubuntu (Debian should work as well)
# TODO
lazygit, pavucontrol?, bluemon?, arandr? (wbu wayland & x?) 
other stuff to consider: scrot xclip dmenu other fonts
could also do huifu for servers/ ssh machines i.e. a minimal huifu specialized on terminal usage and user specific
setup:
arch:
audio
instruction on how and when exactly to setup repo, wbu ssh keys? \_private? 
i3blocks 
file manager
does mise setup work smoothly now? wbu the mise layer
other basic software (check history, e.g. dmenu and arandr)
alternative to konsole or setup konsole properly
"stragglers" in huifu
nm-applet? or is it due to i3blocks?
font cache (damn, completely forgot about that!)
nvim config (and install in arch btw btw)
.profile -> .bash\_profile
interactive wm switcher, or maybe not
use different terminal emulator instead of konsole?
make ssh config and add ssh to huifu
