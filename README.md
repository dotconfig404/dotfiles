# How to run
run huifu.sh, that should take care of it
currently supported: Arch and Ubuntu (Debian should work as well)

# TODO
lazygit, bluemon?

screenshotting software, maybe spectacle

minimal huifu for servers?

host specific configurations?

audio -> pipewire + pipewire-pulse, alsa as backend. thats it. (check for gui interface like pavucontrol)

instruction on how and when exactly to setup repo, wbu ssh keys? \_private? 

font cache refresh upon stowing fonts. need a way to check if fonts have been changed

.profile -> .bash\_profile

wm switcher or desktop manager? nah, wms should live side by side and user should use display manager for switch wms if wanted

make ssh config and add ssh to huifu

use different terminal emulator instead of konsole? for now konsole, because scrollbar, find function and color preview functions. 

nvim config (maybe some day...)
