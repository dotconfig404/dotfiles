# TODO
lazygit, bluemon?

minimal huifu for servers?

instructions on how and when exactly to setup repo, wbu ssh keys? \_private? 

font cache refresh upon stowing fonts. need a way to check if fonts have been changed

nice display manager -> possibly sddm/slim with some fancy theme. probably not going for ly, or simply startx, but could do that if willing to set up monitor config along with them. in that case, would need to check out some alternative fbuffers as well.

use different terminal emulator instead of konsole? for now konsole, because scrollbar, find function and color preview functions. 

nvim config (maybe some day...)

(yellow) theme + theme (or dark mode) switcher? 

anki

keyboard: eu with chinese input, traditional and not. need to research ibus, fcitx5 

syncthing or similar syncing agent for phone and other stuff

host specific monitor setup using arandr and nitrogen/feh -> goes to i3 config

fn keys on laptops?

fancy screensaver

i3 gaps? shadows?

alternative to nm-applet -> freeze on click issue?

blur in terminal, maybe other ones with opacity and blur, or maybe set background image for every window individually (no showing of window thats behind)

rmt = rm trash

find clarity about what to put in profile files instead of rc files
