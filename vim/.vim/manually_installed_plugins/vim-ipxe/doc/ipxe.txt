*ipxe.txt*               Plugin providing syntax highlighing of ipxe scripts

                                                          *ft-ipxe-syntax*
iPXE is an open source network boot firmware, with a scriptable command line
interface for which language this plugin provides syntax highlighting. As these
files might either have "txt" or simply no file extension, filetype detection
relies on their first line being `#!ipxe`.

                                                           *ipxe-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
