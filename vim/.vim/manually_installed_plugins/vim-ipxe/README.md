vim-ipxe
========
A filetype plugin for [vim][] to add syntax highlighting to [iPXE][] scripts.

Install
-------
Use your preferred procedure, just as for installing any plugin. There should
be no special steps required. Please see ':help plugin' if unsure.

Unless having any other preference, the simplest installation method is likely
to merely do something along the lines of:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/git-plugins/start/ || :
    cd ~/.vim/pack/git-plugins/start/
    git clone https://git.netizen.se/vim-ipxe

It might be possible to use a plugin manager of some sorts. Some quirks are in
the [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md).

About
-----
This plugin provides syntax highlighting. A handful of undocumented commands
exist. Syntax highlighting for those are missing. There are likely bugs too.
Patches are welcome, as is positive and constructive feedback.
