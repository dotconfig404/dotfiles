13: 2h
14: 3h working on some wrapper for gas cost and event logging, also created some schematics for the whole token sale process.
15: 6h working on event logging again, trying out a lot to store events from the blockchain in variables for easy access, so far no real solution.. giving up on that for now, as it is too frustrating and time-consuming. continued working on gas testing and implemented a helper smart contract which will be used to deploy the crowdsale contract. that way perhaps event logging is at least for the testing not relevant anymore. reading into a new found module called "eth-gas-reporter" and laying out a new structure for the test classes to perhaps use that one as a easy way to gather important statistics about gas usage.
16; 4h working on new wrapper for testing, to send a lot of transactions at the same time, not quite finished, as it is very slow, even with less than 100 users. if we want to test 1 mill txs it would take forever. set token server up and get the blockchain running there, tested out new module called eth-gas-reporter, very useful! can easily give statistics about gas usage and functions. currently the function for a purchase costs only estimated 56 cents! but it will be more in the end. fixed all compiler warnings, added some new function to the controlledaccess contract as it is needed now for the encryption process.
17: 2h lot of mass testing, nothing really works here.. frustrating to hell!!! give up for now, next time clean up and sorting of libraries.

20: 7h 30m: a lot of restruturing the tests, writing many comments for prab, making a walk-through of all used utilities, preparing to explain to prab what ive done, testing new functionality of utilites and checking with felix' bytecodeGen module. the latter needs more work, tomorrow.
21: 9h 15m writing new tests for new implementation of the contract: bonus system based directly on whitepaper! berating with sergey on general test writing and clearing some things up, implemented new import system so tests dont have to have long require statement headers, trying out functionality of before beforeEach etc indepth (mocha functionality) and running into trouble with eth-gas-reporter, coming up with way to instantiate contracts in each new tests, which is especially important for timed bonus system
22: 5-9: 4h, 3h in afternoon., 3 in evening => 10h mostly struggling hard with eventlogging... even with sergeys help it was hardly possible to do anything. eventually i arrived at using a dirty hack as solution, it works but it coud be way better. but enough time was already wasted here.
23: 4h checking out the API for getting an exchange rate in solidity "usingOraclize", making some tests on cost and speed
24: 4h firther checking, discussing about it with prab, getting prab up to speed explaining to him what ive done and showing the modules fixing some problems on his PC etc.
25: 6h lot of troubleshooting with prab 5h making great progress bringing prab up to speed, having trouble with gitlab felix not helping, thinking of new plans for a website making some first steps into the blocknumber system for auth and timing, lot of discussing and research and a lot fo troubleshooting with geth and ganache, creation of 1000 accounts distribution of ether and reiniting blockchain, making new branches etc etc
26: 7h: discussing some of the website, implementing finally the block timer system  and fixing txManagement for geth, cleaning test file and utils and commenting and stuff like that.
27: 7h wesbite pgroamming, lots of trouble. ugh!!! annyoing, prab and me getting almost nowehre until we learn to apporach things a bit differently, he uses the approach of making a node server and im just gonna write functions convuluted in functions in functions etc
28: 0
29: 9h, did a lot of trial and error with node server learning a bit of express, completely restrcutiring the way bytecode gen works using new module and trying out some stuff with asp and the server there, checking connection of node and asp server and in the end setting up server together with felix for asp.net so deployment is much easier
